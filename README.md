# Commit Quest Daily Check-in

A small mobile-first daily checklist inspired by Commit Quest. Completing daily tasks awards XP, builds a completion history, and persists progress in SQLite.

This application is being built as Phase 7 of João's VPS and networking mentorship. The first version will use Python, Flask, server-rendered HTML, minimal JavaScript, SQLite, and the Europe/Lisbon time zone.

## Initial scope

- One user.
- A fixed daily checklist.
- Each task can award XP once per Lisbon calendar day.
- Persistent completion history.
- Mobile-first interface.
- A small health endpoint for service monitoring.
- Private deployment through Tailscale after the application is complete and reviewed.

## Deliberately excluded from the first version

- Public access.
- User registration or passwords.
- Multiple accounts.
- Third-party APIs.
- Full synchronization with the original Commit Quest application.
- Containers or automated deployment.

Full Commit Quest synchronization will be evaluated after the daily check-in application is complete, deployed, backed up, monitored, and understood.

## Development workflow

- Work from a focused GitHub issue.
- Use a feature branch for application changes.
- Open a pull request before merging to `main`.
- Keep commits small and beginner-readable.
- Do not deploy unfinished work to the VPS.
